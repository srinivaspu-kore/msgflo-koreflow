A bigger embedded system is built using several embedded devices, each performing a set of tasks, and communicating with each other using a messing queue service (typically running on an IoT gateway). Some devices act as sensors, some as actuators and some provide computation.

Typical execution environments include Embedded Linux, microcontrollers. Typical messaging systems used are MQTT.
